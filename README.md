# CFD_Motorsport_Portfolio

Welcome to my personal CFD portfolio, focused on race car aerodynamics and high-performance simulation workflows. This repository highlights my work in:

- CFD simulation for Formula Student aerodynamic development  
- Advanced turbulence modeling (RANS, LES, DES)  
- Python-based post-processing and simulation automation  
- Correlation studies using aero rake and wind tunnel data  

My passion lies in using engineering insight and simulation tools to push the performance envelope in motorsport.
