# CFD_Motorsport_Portfolio

Welcome to my personal CFD portfolio, focused on race car aerodynamics and high-performance simulation workflows. This repository highlights my work in:

- CFD simulation for Formula Student aerodynamic development  
- Advanced turbulence modeling (RANS, LES, DES)  
- Python-based post-processing and simulation automation  
- Correlation studies using aero rake and wind tunnel data  

My passion lies in using engineering insight and simulation tools to push the performance envelope in motorsport.

## Featured Projects

### Formula Student â€“ Front Wing Optimization

> **Goal**: Maximize downforce while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency.

- CAD designed in Creo; meshed and simulated in STAR-CCM+
- Achieved **10% increase in downforce** with design iteration
- Included **validation using aero rake data**

---

### Aero Correlation & Validation

> **Goal**: Bridge CFD predictions and experimental data from track testing.

- Correlated STAR-CCM+ results with real-world aero rake measurements
- Delta reduced to **<10%** across key flow metrics (Cl, Cp)

---

### CFD Automation with Python

> **Goal**: Speed up post-processing and reduce manual setup time.

- Developed scripts for automated:
  - Mesh quality analysis
  - Cp/Cl extraction from STAR-CCM+ output
  - Batch run preparation
